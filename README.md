In general, I agree with the premise of harpoon in that you are often only editing the same 4-5 files at once but I find temporarily memorizing where each file is in the list
almost impossible to achieve.

Thus, I created a basic floating window into the harpoon list which is automatically updated by hooking into Harpoon's own events. These events were only a recent feature of harpoon 2 
and thus this extension is only compatible with Harpoon2 and above.
